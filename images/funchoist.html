*/Self-Invoking Functions
Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".
A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().
You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.
You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression:*/

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Functions can be invoked automatically without being called:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
(function () {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello! I called myself";
})();
</script>

</body>
</html>
